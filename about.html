                <p>Let me share with you a quote from Paul Arden's book <i>It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be</i> :</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    <h3>"Failure is a major contributor to success"</h3>
                </div>
                <p>This quote shaped my mindset and helped me to become a better designer. A thousand failures brought me to where I am today. It's the initiative, ambition and passion, that I have which turned those countless failures and mistakes into success.</p>
                <p>Now that you've gotten a better idea of who I am, feel free to take a look at my <a href="projects.html">recent creations &#10230;</a></p>
